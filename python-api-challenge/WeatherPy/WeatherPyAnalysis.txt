WeatherPy Trend Analysis:
--------------------------

Max temperature tends to increase as latitude approaches zero (the Equator) from either direction, but latitudes south of the Equator are warmer on average.

There is little to no correlation between latitude and wind speed in either hemisphere (Northern or Southern)

Humidity tends to increase as latitude becomes more positive (+)
